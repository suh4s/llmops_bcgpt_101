It marked a rebirth of classical learning and wisdom after the Middle Ages. The movement began in Florence, Italy, and spread throughout Europe, revolutionizing art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Key figures like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo emerged, exemplifying the period's ideal of the "Renaissance Man" - someone who excelled in multiple disciplines. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 helped spread Renaissance ideas by making books more accessible to the general public. This period also saw significant developments in scientific thinking, with scholars beginning to question traditional authorities and rely more on empirical observation.""",
